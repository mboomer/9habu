Desmond Boomer, my older brother, was a Belfast born engineer working in the Libyan oil-fields, he disappeared in December 1995. Officially the plane on which he was a passenger, crashed as a result of mechanical failure and pilot error. His travelling companions were an English engineer Michael Williams (49), a Polish national Tadeus Gorny (48) and Maltese nationals Philip Farrugia (43) and Matthew Aquilina (22).The pilot, Carmelo Bartolo (47) was also Maltese.
