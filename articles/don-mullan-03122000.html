He worked in the  Libyan oil fields as an engineer for a company based in Britain.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of international sanctions imposed  against Libya by the UN in  1992 after the Lockerbie  bombing, foreign workers  were forced to fly to a  neighbouring country and  travel onwards to Libya by  road.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Boomer and other  workers, the preferred  route was an international  connection to Malta and a  private flight from the  island to Djerba Airport in  Tunisia. Boomer was en  route home to Belfast for  his Christmas holidays  when he disappeared.  There are three possibilities concerning the disappearance.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and one that cannot be easily dismissed is that Desmond Boomer and his fellow pasengenieers were in the wrong place at the wrong time when Islamic fundamentalists arrived to exact revenge on their pilot, Carmel Bartolo, a marked man. Bartolo was the owner of a small private airline called Excelair.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 5, 1995 precisely one month before Boomers mysterious disappearance a local Maltese newspaper <em>Kull Hadd</em>, in an act of gross journalistic irresponsi-</div>

                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bility implicated Bartolo  as an accomplice in the  assassination of lslamic Jihad leader. Fathi Shqaqi  by members of the Israeli  secret service, Mossad, ten  days previously in Malta.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspaper carried  a front-page report that  the Shqaqi assassins may have left Malta on a Maltese registered and piloted private plane. Alarmingly the paper printed along-side the story a photograph of an Excelair aircraft, the company owned by Barlolo who was the pilot responsible for ﬂying Desmond Boomer and his fellow passengers to Malta on the night of their disappearance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 9, 1995, <em>The Times of Malta</em> led  with the headline, “Shqaqi‘s assassins may  have left Malta on private  plane”. The article stated that the Maltese police had received information from Europol detailing  how the assassins left the   island. For security reasons no further details were given but The Times article continued: "Other sources said the police were working on the theory that the men left the island on board a private plane hired from a local company and flown by a  Maltese pilot."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second possibility is that Desmind Boomer along with his fellow travellers, was abducted by Islamic fundamentalists and may still be alive, despite the the fact that no demands of ransom were ever made by way of

While it is understandable the families of the disappeared would wish to maintain a glimmer of hope, this is the least likely of the three possibilities.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third possibility is that their ﬂight, 9H-ABU, a light single-engined Piper Lance aircraft had been recklessly flown by Bartolo in to a menacing Mediteranerranean storm, despite mechanical difficulties on a harrowing  outboard flight. In this  scenario, the aircraft is  presumed to have crashed,  resulting in the death of  the pilot and all five passengers.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE MALTESE authorities would prefer this to be the  conclusion, since it avoids  connsequent diplomatic  tensions between its three  powerful neighbours: Isreal, the Islamic states and the the European Union, Malta is actively aspiring  to join the latter bloc. Despire the fact that   the largest air and sea search since the World  War II was conducted in the immediate aftermath of the disappearance of  Flight 9H-ABU, nothing was found and no bodies were ever recovered. The search involved sea and aircraft from five coun-  tries: Malta, Italy, Tunisia, France and the United States. The latter used specialised underwater search equipment,  concentrating on an area in the Gulf of Gebas where, in this scenario, the plane was suspected of crashing.

Cormac  Boomer, says that in the days that followed he  endeavoured to come to  terms with what he could  only perceive as a tragic  air accident.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, two weeks after the incident. he  received a phone call from  Geoff Williams. the  brother of Michael  Williams, a British passenger also missing from the ﬂight, which was to radically chnage his view of the incident. "It set me  off on the long search for my son. If I could not ﬁnd him, I at least wanted to find the truth surrounding  his disappearance.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sworn affidavit presented to the Maltese inquiry into the incident,  Boomer states that  Williams informed him that on December 12, 1995, his nephew, Andrew  Williams, Michael‘s son, was in a government building in Malta where he was investigating the circumstances of his father's disappearance. While there, he told his uncle that he met a Dr. Philip Sciberas, who took him into his office, asked</div>

Sciberas is said to have replied: "No." Williams then asked: "Is it in Libya?".</div>
                    
                    <div class="newspaper-col newspaper-col-6"> Sciberas is said to have responded: "It‘s on the  ground in Tripoli."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Boomer, Sciberas then said to Andrew Williams: "If you repeat this conversation to anyone outside this room, I will deny that I ever  made such a statement."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Ireland on Sunday</em> has in its possession a copy of a letter sent by Cormac Boomer to the head of the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs. Sean O hUiginn, dated December 18, 1995, in which he details the above and in which a Dr. Philip Sciberas is named as the author of the above comments.

Dr Sciberras has since  threatened legal action against Cormac Boomer and Geotf Williams, denying that he is the person who spoke with Andrew Williams.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pursuit of the truth surrounding his son's disappearance, Boomer attended, at his own expense, ten sitting's of the board of inquiry in Valletta, chaired by Dr. Philip Sciberas.</div>

I have  examined and photographed these items and it is obvious they do not show any sign of the deterioration and corrosion one would expect to find on components submerged in salt water for ten months.
