                <p></p>
                
                <p>Hi Don<br><br>Last Thursday I received an acknowledgement of my letter to Brian Cowan TD from his Private Secretary, today I received a phone call from John Lawton. He began by telling me that your article in the IOS had generated enquiries from other papers, he then moved to discussing my request for government support in my quest for information about my missing son, he enquired was there not some other channels that I might consider using ie legal action against the authorities in Malta. I pointed out that I had already spent considerable amounts of my own resources in my ongoing search and could not undertake an action of this kind as it would involve hiring legal representation here and in Malta. Hence my reason for asking for government support.</p>

                <p>I then spent the next hour going over the incident with him reminding him of the documentation which I had already supplied to his department and filling in details of other items that had come to hand since I had last spoken to him eighteen tnonths ago. It was obvious he was gathering information and details to facilitate Mr. Cowan's reply. We spoke on the phone for an hour and a quarter and I could tell by his questions that he was genuinely surprised by the content of my comments which he stated he would be conveying to the Minister.</p>

                <p>Before signing off he informed me that the Ambassador to Rome would be visiting Dublin this week for discussions (I understand that John as Principal Officer in that Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for Irish Consuls throughout the World) and that he would raise the matter of my missing son with him, he also indicated he would discuss my request for govermnent support with the Taoiseach Mr. Ahern who would be making an official visit to Malta sometime in January next year</p>
                <p>
                    Merry Christmas<br>
