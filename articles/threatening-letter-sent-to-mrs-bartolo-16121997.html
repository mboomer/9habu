              <p>DEAR MRS BARTOLO</p>
              <p>READ THIS LETTER CAREFULLY AND UNDERSTAND EACH WORD OF IT</p>
              <p>A COPY WAS SEND TO EUROJET TO CAPT BARTOLO XUEREB TO INFORM HIM WHAT HAPPENED.
              <p>WE SEND THIS TO YOU TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.</p>
              <p>WE PRAY FOR YOUR HUSBAND.</p>

              <p>MALTA</p>
              <p>DEAR CAPTAIN CARMEL XUEREB</p>
              <p>Two years have passed already since the last victory was a success to us. Just to remind you of what happened at that time.</p>
              <p>We have adviced many and many times to Bartolo of excelair to stop flights to our country DJERBA. But unfortunately he did he did not respond to our demands to to stop his flights aand he started to continue as nornal. So we had to stop him from continuing.
              We decided to destroy him in mid air and no-one till now knows what happened during his return flight to MALTA AND I MUST SAY THAT NOONE WILL EVER KNOW WHO DESTROYED HIM.</p>

              <p>Our reason for for all this, is that we have to operate from djerba to Malta and no air carrier from your island we have frequent flights from Djerba and our operations are enough.</p>

              <p>This is the most interesting part of the letter to you. I arrived yesterday from Djerba late at night where I meet a friend of mine who took me from the airport to your parked plane a a Cessna Citation 9H-ACR (a nice aircraft you have).
              I have mounted to your aircraft underneath a very small but powerful remote control explosive secured in a very safe place, difficult to find if you search for it. This will explode if you land in Djerba only.</p>

              <p>As form 1st January 1998 do not attempt to land in Djerba cause after take off we will by the use of our remote control will activate the explosion and it will happen again after two years. WE PRAY FOR YOU.</p>

              <p>Read this letter to yourself and talk to your directors about this. NOW it is best responsibility not to operate to our country. It is better to save YOURSELF, THE AIRCRAFT, THE PASSENGERS AND FOR SURE THE COMPANY. FLY EVERYWHERE BUT NOT TO DJERBA. LET US OPERATE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.</p>

              <p>HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND OUR NEEDS. WE NEED THE ROUTE VERY BADLY.</p>
              <p>HAVE A SAFE FLIGHTS ANYWHERE BUT NOT IN DJERBA.</p>
              <p>SHALOM</p>
              <p>TRULY YOURS</p>
