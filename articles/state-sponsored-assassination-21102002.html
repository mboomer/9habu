                    <p><strong>Fathi Shiqaqi</strong></p>

                    <p>Oct. 26, 1995. The Israeli Mossad secret service assassinated Palestinian leader Dr. Fathi Shiqaqi.</p>

                    <p>Thursday, Oct. 26, 1995. Shiqaqi was shot in broad daylight in Malta.</p>

                    <p>Maltese police said Dr. Shiqaqi was killed in a "professional job" as he walked out of his hotel in Sliema, outside the capital, Valletta.</p>

                    <p>He was approached by two men riding a motorcycle, and was shot five times in the head with a silenced gun. The assailants later abandoned their vehicle, which had false licence plates.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Shiqaqi was a medical doctor and a former Gazan who was deported in 1991 and had been living in Damascus.</p>

                    <p>Israel has not admitted carrying out the assassination but hardly bothered to deny it was involved.</p>

                    <p>Prime Minister Yizhak Rabin, said he knew nothing about the killing of Dr. Shiqaqi. When asked if he would express remorse over his governments policy of state-sponsored assassinations or the death of Shiqaqi, Rabin replied, "I won't be sorry."</p>

                    <p>Israeli newspapers praised the "long arm" of Israel and welcomed its determination to "smash the Palestinian vipers head". The assassination of Dr. Shiqaqi required "exceptional operational ability", boasted Yaacov Erez, editor of Maariv. one of the largest Israeli daily newspapers.</p>

                    <p>On November 18, 1996, an Israeli military court in Jaffa sentenced four Israeli undercover unit officers to one hour in jail and fined them one agora (about 1/3 of a cent) for assassinating the wrong Palestinian in 1993. This incident reﬂects the racist contempt for Palestinian life present in most sectors of lsraeli society.</p>

On May 20, 2002 Jibril was killed by a car bomb. The terror bombing was the work of the Israeli government's Mossad secret service, which is subsidized by American taxpayers as part of the US government’s "War on terror", a euphemism for terrorizing opponents of Zionism. The victim's foot can be seen dangling from the wreckage in the photo above.</p>

                    <p>Elie Hobeika, a key witness in the Sabra-Chatila war crimes case being pursued in a Belgian court against Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon, was blown up outside his house in Beirut on Jan. 24, 2002, together with three bodyguards and a civilian bystander. The car-bomb was the work of professional assassins in the employ of Mossad, the Israeli secret service. The explosion occured two days after Hobeika agreed to give evidence against Sharon in Belgium. Hobeika had met Belgian Senators Josy Dubie and Vincent van Quickenborne in east Beirut, agreeing to be a witness at any trial of Sharon for the Sabra and Chatila massacre.</p>

                    <p>Belgian lawyers seeking to indict Sharon expressed their "profound shock" at Hobeika's murder. "Mr Hobeika had several times expressed his wish to assist the Belgian inquiry on the massacres at Sabra and Chatila", a statement from the Belgian lawyers said, "His determination to do so was reported widely on the eve of his assassination. The elimination of the key protagonist who offered to assist with the inquiry is an obvious attempt to undermine our case." Marwan Hamadeh, the Lebanese minister for refugees stated,"My initial evaluation is that of course Israel doesn't want witnesses against it in this historic case in Belgium..." Israeli Prime Minister Sharon dismissed the charges: "I am simply saying, from our point of view, we have no link to this subject at all, and this is not worthy of a comment", Sharon told reporters.</p>

                    <p class="hoffman-image"><img src="article-images/hoffman7.jpg"/></p>

                    <p class="hoffman-img-txt">Mahmoud Abu Hanoud was assassinated when Israelis bombed the car in which he was traveling near Nablus, on November 23, 2001</p>
        
                    <p>...while the Israelis say they've always gone after ‘terrorist‘ targets ...they've in fact also gone after those members of the Palestinian leadership who have two important attributes: One, they were interested in a two-state solution, and two, they were the kind of people who were strong enough to be the peace party in Palestinian leadership. Most of these guys have been killed. Frankly, I have long suspected the Israeli strategy is to kill the moderate Palestinians as well as militants and send this thing careering towards an endgame where Israel has the extremist enemy it wants.</p>

                    <p>...one need only consult an exceptional recent story in the right-of-center Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot for conﬁrmation of this idea. On November 25, Alex Fishman, the paper's security expert reported that the Israeli government was aware that the Palestinian Authority had ﬁnally prevailed on Hamas in mid November to accept a quiet, tenuous deal in which Hamas would refrain from any suicide attacks within Israel's pre-1967 borders.</p>

                    <p>All bets were off, however, alfer the November 23 Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Mahmoud Abu Hanoud which, according to Fishman, was exactly what Sharon's government wanted. "Whoever gave a green light to this act of liquidation knew full well that he is thereby shattering in one blow the gentleman's agreement between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority", Fishman wrote. 2Whoever decided upon the liquidation of Abu Hunud knew in advance that that would be the price. The subject was extensively discussed both by Israel‘s military echelon and its political one, before it was decided to carry out the liquidation. Now, the security bodies assume that Hamas will embark on a concerted effort to carry out suicide bombings, and preparations are made accordingly."</p>

                    <p>...Sharon is driving Palestinian society more and more to the right, to the fanatics, which is calculated to create the results he wants.</p>

                    <p>...In 1923, radical Zionist Ze'ev Jabotinsky - spiritual father of not only of Menachem Begin but of Meir Kahane wrote that the "sole way" for Jews to deal with Arabs in Palestine was through ‘total avoidance of all attempts to arrive at a settlement, which Jabotinsky euphemistically termed the "Iron wall" approach. Not coincidentally, a picture of Jabotinsky graces Sharon‘s desk.</p>

                    <p>On May 20, 2001 Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered the murder of Jibril Rajoub by bombing his home in Ramallah. All told, his house was hit from three sides, his car was destroyed, and his 11-year-old son's bedroom was left with bullet-pocked walls.</p>

                    <p>as one of the more moderate and pragmatic Palestinian officials. Talmudic liar Benjamin Ben Eliezer, the Jewish "Defense" Minister was caught in yet another Israeli lie when he claimed that Israeli army troops were only retuming ﬁre after "massive ﬁre" was directed at them from the grounds of Mr. Rajoub‘s home. This Jewish liar also said that the Israeli troops did not know at whose home they were aiming their tanks. An Israeli army ﬁeld commander, however, Lieutenant Colonel Erez Weiner, contradicted Eliezer's ofﬁcial position by saying on the Israeli radio May 21 that he knew very well to whom the house belonged. Army officials quickly said that Lt. Col. Weiner‘s statement was "an error." Rajoub is certain he was personally targeted, just as Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian oﬂicial in Gaza, must have been targeted when his Jeep was riddled with bullets by Israeli troops earlier this year (2001). The Israeli government, Rajoub said, was acting "like a Maﬁa." "Mine is one in a series of attacks in the last three weeks," Mr. Rajoub said. "I think it's part of a policy to undermine the Palestinian Authority and make it collapse." Some Israelis viewed the incident similarly. Akiva Eldar, a senior columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, said: "The shelling of Jibril Rajoub's house removes any remaining doubts. Ariel Sharon has decided to turn the Palestinian Authority into the enemy."</p>

                    <p>Rajoub's house is well-known. Neighbors say shooting never originates ﬁ"om Mr. Rajoub‘s house.</p>

                    <p>The Jewish-American ambassador to the Israeli state. Martin Indyk, who rarely engages in such public criticism, said on Monday that the Israeli Army Forces were now counterproductively "hitting" (Maﬁa euphemism for assassination) those who were in a position to stop the violence, like Palestinian police oﬂicers and Mr. Rajoub."Maybe the strategy is to encourage them to act against their own people." Mr. Indyk said in an address at Ben Gurion University in Beersheva, "but l don‘t imagine there is an example in history where such a strategy has succeeded."</p>

                    <p>A local Palestinian leader in the town of Tulkann was shot dead by the Israeli anny as he drove out of his driveway, Dec. 31, 2000. Thabet Thabet was a senior member of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement. The assassination was the latest of 20 Palestinians who have been targeted and murdered by the Israeli army or Israeli undercover units. Dr. Thabet, a dentist, had worked for Physicians for Human Rights in furnishing medical aid to Palestinians wounded and disabled by Israeli gunfire. The Fatah leader on the West Bank, Marwan Barghouthi, said the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, must have personally approved the killing. Cf. Daily Telegraph (London) Jan. 1, 2001.</p>

                    <p>Time magazine justiﬁed Dr. Thabet's murder by describing him as a leader of Fatah (the legally recognized Palestinian political party) in an area of the Palestinian ghetto where there had been unrest. This is akin to justifying the murder of a black dentist by the L.A.P.D. because he was a leader of the Democratic party in an area of the Los Angeles ghetto experiencing unrest. (Cf. caption under Dr. Thabet‘s photograph in Time magazine, Jan. 15, 2001; hard-copy edition).</p>

                    <p>June 22, 1995. The Mossad, the Israeli secret service, assassinated a Palestinian leader in the Gaza Strip today. Mahmud el-Khawaja, 34, who worked in the United Nations refugee programme, UNWRA, was shot to death as he was walking to work. Khawaja was shot as three men drove past him in the Shatti refugee camp in a blue Peugeot 404. Two Israeli gunmen in the car ﬁred pistols fitted with silencers, hitting him in the head and chest. The Palestinian Authority condemned the murder as an act of terrorism and launched a search for the gunmen.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fathi Shiqaqi</strong></p>

                    <p>Oct. 26, 1995. The Israeli Mossad secret service assassinated Palestinian leader Dr. Fathi Shiqaqi. Thursday, Oct. 26, 1995. Shiqaqi was shot in broad daylight in Malta. Maltese police said Dr. Shiqaqi was killed in a "professional job" as he walked out of his hotel in Sliema, outside the capital, Valletta. He was approached by two men riding a motorcycle, and was shot ﬁve times in the head with a silenced gun. The assailants later abandoned their vehicle, which had false licence plates.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Shiqaqi was a medical doctor and a former Gazan who was deported in 1991 and had been living in Damascus. Israel has not admitted carrying out the assassination but hardly bothered to deny it was involved. Prime Minister Yizhak Rabin, said he knew nothing about the killing of Dr. Shiqaqi. When asked if he would express remorse over his government's policy of state-sponsored assassinations or the death of Shiqaqi, Rabin replied, "I won‘t be sorry."</p>

                    <p>Israeli newspapers praised the "long arm" of Israel and welcomed its determination to "smash the Palestinian viper's head". The assassination of Dr. Shiqaqi required "exceptional operational ability", boasted Yaacov Erez, editor of Maariv, one of the largest Israeli daily newspapers.</p>

                    <p>On November 18, 1996, an Israeli military court in Jaffa sentenced four Israeli undercover unit officers to one hour in jail and ﬁned them one agora (about 1/3 of a cent) for assassinating the wrong Palestinian in 1993. This incident reﬂects the racist contempt for Palestinian life present in most sectors of Israeli society.</p>
