                <p>Hi Don<br><br>Your e-mail received, here are the answers to your queries, some are already in your possession, ie the document “ The Search for My Missing Son"</p>

                <p>Q1 The plane let Malta at approx. 8:45 pm on Saturday, she was seen taking to the air by the pilot / engineer who was a member of the panel in the ﬁrst tape, he is interviewed on the second where he conﬁrms this fact</p>

                <p>Q2,3,4 &amp; 5 The passengers on ﬂight were ( page 2 paragraphs 10,11, 12 )</p>

                <p>Q6 The Piper Investigator was called in by the Malta Civil Aviation Dept, his brief was to examine the debris only and present his ﬁndings, to Board in open session. His verbal report as recorded by myself on Wednesday 14 May 1997 are in a document which should be in your possession, but if not I can fax you a copy, however this matter is dealt with and record in the transcripts, when Mr Alfred Fenech ( par. 13 ) stated at three separate sittings of the Board that based on the report of Rodger Wood the plane would be unable to start up and totally incapable of taking off.</p>

                <p>Desmond rang home twice on the Saturday from Djerba, the ﬁrst time in early aﬂernoon to inform Mandy that he was on his way home ( he was not expected to travel home until the 13 th) his second call was around 8-30 pm ( ie 7-30 Malta time) He said there was very bad weather and that he did not expect to ﬂy out until sometime on Sunday. According to Cecilia Mathew rang home on ﬁve occasions on Saturday the last time around 7-30 pm Malta time to say he would be stopping over because of bad weather. It is also recorded that he withdrew cash from a hole in the wall at about 9-45 pm</p>

                <p>The Mayday Alarm was raised at about six am but reports suggest the ofﬁcial operation did not get off the ground until ﬁve hours later, the most speciﬁc information I have on this matter was given to me by young Philip Bartolo the son of the pilot. He is now deceased (RIP) his badly decomposed body was found in a locked up garage two years after the incident ( it was said he was a druggie ) However when I spoke with him in November 96 he said that private ﬂiers in their own planes were the ﬁrst people in the air in the search the and the ﬁrst planes took off one and a quarter hours after the mayday was broadcast he explained to me that the planes spread out over the course it was expected his father would ﬂy on his return trip from Djerba they ﬂew at around 500/ l000ft into the storm to the general area of the reported crash and they saw and found nothing I recall he repeated what he ﬁrst said to me when we ﬁrst spoke on the phone in December 95, quote, "no one will ever convince me that that plane went down in the water and nothing ﬂoated from it”</p>

                <p>Don I hope this covers all the points in your e-mail if not send me another and if necessary I can take a run down and bring my main ﬁles with me</p>

                <p>Cormac.</p>
