                Gaddafi on Malta, Lockerbie

Col 1

The Libyan People's Bureau has
just released the text of an Eng-
lish translation of the speech
made by Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddaﬁ on 5 February, just after
the sentencing of the Lockerbie 
tribunal.
Predictably the Libyan leader_
mentions Malta and Maltese per-
sons throughout his speech.
The Libyan leader indicated that
American Intelligence had ﬁxed a
list with names of a number of
countries and organisations to
accuse in this case after having
determined that Malta, Germany 
and Britian are the countries
through which the bomb trav-
elled. The selection of these coun-
tries had been political in order to
look for an accused and to dis-
mis the others.
Some of those people who have
a conscience were the first to
speak publicly after the verdict.
The international lawyer profes-
sor Robert Black who directs
court procedures with the consent
of all parties confirmed that all
the elements of the case against
Abdel Basset Al Megrahi were
very weak.
Analysts are wondering how

Abdul Basset could have been
present in Valletta, Frankfurt and
Heathrow airport in London on
the same day in order to check in
the notorious bag from one plane
an another. No rational judge or
any one with a conscience could
prove that Abdel Basset could be
persent in Valletta, Frankfrut and
Heathrow on the same day.
Malta, Germany and Britain...
Which country was accused of
letting the bomb through? The
accused is Libya.
The Western public has been
fooled and ridiculed by the fabri-
cation of the imperialist circles.
They have politically selected
Libya. Libya is the accused. They
say: Can we accuse Germany for
being lenient with security? Shall
we accuse Great Britain? They
said yes to accusing Malta. Let
Libya go to hell and let Malta go
to hell. They chose Malta because
it is the weaker link.
The bomb thus had to be in
Malta. Even if it was in Frankfurt
or Heathrow. They agreed it had
to be the Luqa airport in Malta,
even if there were evidence of
Libya's non-involvement, they
would still say it is Libya.
There is a Maltese analyst, who
is quite well-known, called Mif-
sud. He followed the case from
the start and felt shocked. He
said: "I do not know how the
judges reached this verdict."
They say it is difficult to place
an unaccompanied suitcase on a
planc in Malta because of the
security measures  court and
the judges admitted the measures
in Luqa airport are strict and no
unaccompanied luggage could
pass through, except with its
owner.
Thc Judges however said the
bomb emanated from Malta. This
is in stark contrast to what the
analyst said. The analyst is very
clear it is ditﬁcult to place a suit-
case in Malta airport but the
judges issued their verdict on the
basis that the suitcase was plant-
ed in Malta. This is illogical and
illegal, it is a farce.

The affadavit says that no unac-
companied suitcase leaves Malta
airport.'Even though the judges
rule it was planted in Malta air-
port, they themselves said they do
not know how it was planted.
The judges have no other option 
than to commit suicide. To resign
or to tell the truth as to why they
contradicted the afﬁdavit. The
judges have conﬁrmed in their
Affidavit the suitcase from Malta
contained the bomb but they did
not prove that there was a suitcase
from Malta.
The Maltese connection was not
proven. They could not establish
whether the bomb emanated from
Malta. The key witness in the
case was the shopkeeper Tony
Gauci. He changed his testimony
several times. He said Abdel Bas-
set worked in Malta whereas it
was Fhimah who worked in
Malta.
Let us tackle Tony Gauci. The
last witness who saw Fhimah and
accused him of planting the suit-
case in the airport, Gauci, the
owner of a shop called Mary's
House, sells shoes. His testimony
is undermined as he was not sure
in his testimony.
This witness, Gauci, is a key
witness. What did the court say
about him. From paragraph 55 to
69 it confirmed that his testi-
monies were contrasting as he
was not sure about Abdel Bassets
description and he was not certain
of the state of the weather that day.
Sometimes he said it was raining
and at other times he said it was
not raining. The date of the pur-
chase was also varied. Some-
times he said it was 7 
December, and another time he 
said it was 23 November.
In contrast to the court ruling on
Bollier and Giaka the court said
that the Maltese witness was honest
and sincere and his testimony
could be relied upon. The ﬁrst
impression about this witness is
that he is honest and he tries
hard to tell the truth. This is of
course in Libyas interest because
the honest witness is in Libya‘s

favour and would confirm the
innocense.
The court ruled that this witness
is credible and honest. But this
witness never identified Abdel
Basset positively.
A number of persons were
paraded before this witness, one
of them was called Mohammad
Salem. He told them it was
Mohammed Salem who bought
the clothes.
They brought another photo and
he said it is close to him. The
person's name was Abu Talb. But
they still dismissed him. The
court said there was a long time
between the purchase of the
clothes and the identiﬁcation of
Gauci and this makes it impossi-
ble for him to identify who
bought the clothes.
They asked him nine months
after the purchase to remember
who bought the clothes from the
shop and people go in xxxxxxxxxxxxx
nine months thousands would have
entered the shop from all national-
ities. How would be remember
Abdel Basset? It is not possihle for
any Shopkeeper to remember who
bought trousers and shirts because
every day there are scores of peo-
ple who come. It is not practical to
ask the shopkeeper who bought it
after nine months.
There is another criminal expert
in the FBI investigation called
Thurman. This Thurman is an
officer in the American FBI. He
took his son from that plane just
half an hour before it took off. He
told his son not to travel on that
plane. This was revealed by
American investigations and has
been recorded in the court filling.
Why did Solar cancel his flight
with seven of his aides on the ill-
fared flight and booked at a later
flight? Who is Pik Botha? He is a
racist from South Africa who was
supposed to the flight and
seven of his assistants cancelled
the ﬂight at the last moment. It
has been proven that for the pre-
vious ten years he never changed
his booking arrangements even
once.
