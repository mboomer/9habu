              <span class="header-blue">The Search Phase</span>

              <p>1.5 SEARCH PHASE `</p>
              <p>08h 50mn<br />Malta Regional Control Centre advised by message that the Maltese Centre for Search and Rescue Co-ordination (RCC) is prepared to proceed with the search for the lost plane with the help of two search and rescue (SAR) planes based at Malta in a zone of the Maltese Search and Rescue region (SRR) defined as follows: (see annexed card)</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">34 degrees 35°N 11 degrees 30°E<br />34 degrees 48°N 11 degrees 53°E<br />34 degrees 25°N 12 degrees 15°E<br />34 degrees 01°N 11 degrees 30°E<br />34 degrees 35°N 11 degrees 30°E</p>
              <p>In the same message Maltese Regional Control Centre asks Tunis Search and Rescue (Tunis Search and Rescue, even though the terms of SAR N 75-155 decree of 7 March 1975 has not yet been made use of in Tunisia to this day) to proceed to search in the zone relevant to the Tunis SRR Search and Rescue Co-ordination Centre to the south of the latitude 34 degrees 35N. At the same time it requests authorisation from Tripoli Search and Rescue to permit two Maltese planes to search in the relevant area of the Maltese defined search zone which overlaps with a part of the Libyan search and rescue region.</p>
              <p>10h 33mn<br />Tunisian air force planes begin searching in the different zones of Tunis search and rescue region and continue throughout the day.</p>
              <p>15h 46mn<br />The Search and Rescue Co-ordinator of the Maltese Centre for Search and Rescue Co-ordination has asked that it be made precisely aware of the zones in which searches have been undertaken by Tunisian and Libyan search and rescue planes and to confirm that these searches have been completed. As for Malta Centre for Search and Rescue Co-ordination, nothing has been turned up and the searches in the Maltese flight information region will continue right up to sunset and will re-commence the following morning (4.12.95). In the same message, the Maltese express their<br />wish to receive a precise reply about the search zones covered by the Tunisians.</p>
              <p>17h 43mn<br />The Search and Rescue Co-ordinator of the Maltese Centre for Search and Rescue Co-ordination gives an account of the suspension of the searches for the day (3.12.95) and of the resumption of operations the following day (4.12.95) at first light and asks Tunis and Tripoli Search and rescue Centres if they wish to pursue the searches. At 7h 30mn on 4.12.95 the Northern Zone Military Operations Centre, in the absence of a<br />Tunisian Search and Rescue operative and an agreement on co-operation in the Search and Rescue domain with Malta on which the search and rescue region borders, refers to two messages sent the previous evening a l7h 43mn by the Maltese Search and Rescue to initiate and advising that the searches have begun in the zone propose by Malta. This constituted the beginning of direct co-ordination between the Northern Zone Military Operations Centre, Tunis and Malta Regional Control Centres and unites the co-ordination duties normally devolved to a single regional control centre.</p>
              <p>Tunisian Air force searches in the zones co-ordinated with Malta Regional Control Centre are pursued right up to 7.12.95. The searches of the Maltese coast are pursued right up to today (18.12.95) with some days of interruption. The TUNISAVIA company participated equally in the searches by providing two helicopter flights on 3.12.95. Then the Tunisians, Maltese with the participation of the US and Libyan navy proceeded to search in their respective regions with some flexibility in using their respective air spaces. All the searches have been unsuccessful to date.</p>

              <span class="header-blue">Interception Of A Distress Signal By A Boat Sailing Towards Sfax</span>

              <p>1.6 INTERCEPTION OF A DISTRESS SIGNAL BY A BOAT SAILING TOWARDS SFAX</p>
              <p>On 4.12.95 around 08h 00mn SFAX control tower was informed by the "British Gas company" at Sfax of the following:</p>
              <p>The boat "Supply Asperay" announces having received a distress call on 3/12/95 at 04h 44mn originating from a location at 6 nautical miles north east of Miskar 34 degrees 22°N 11 degrees 52°E on the emergency frequency 121.5 Mhz.</p>
              <p>Taking account of the time at which the distress signal was received by the aforementioned ship (O4h 41mn) and the time of the missing plane's last radio contact with Djerba (04h 11mn) and of the estimated place of locating the distress signal, this allows a presumption that the signal received originated from the missing plane 9H-ABU. It is stressed that this information had been transmitted as soon as it had been received by the services controlling air traffic at the Northern Zone Military Operations Centre (COZ-Nord Djebel Kebir) and the Maltese Search and Rescue Centre.</p>
              <p>After verification from the world centre for location distress signals by satellite at Toulouse (COSPAS/SARSAT) it is proven that during the day of 3.12.95 Tunisian territory was not covered by satellite during the hours of 3h 30mn and 4h 52mn.</p>
              <p>This would explain that the distress signal detected by the "Supp1y Asperay" at 04h 41mn and which would not have lasted throughout the relevant time, could not have been detected at the same time by the satellite.</p>

              <p>1.10 NAVIGATION AIDS</p>
              <p>Djerba airport is equipped with aerial navigation aids (ILS, VOR, DME, LOCATOR) which were functioning on the day on which the plane in question disappeared.</p>
              <p>The Djerba to Lampedusa main route on which the plane lost radio contact with the Maltese air traffic control is situated above sea level on a radial 043 from the Djerba VHF Omni Range.</p>

              <span class="header-blue">Telecommunications</span>

              <p>1.11 TELECOMMUNICATIONS<br />Taking account of the low altitude of the place, it has been agreed between Tunis Regional Control Centre and Djerba control tower that this was the last bearing radio contact had with the plane was on its leaving Tunisian flight information region and its transfer to Maltese control. In the course of that evening, a momentary interruption in direct contact had been recorded and had been overcome by recourse to the assistance equipment at Djerba. The pilot had not indicated any anomalies during his flight in Tunisian airspace.</p>

              <span class="header-blue">Information On The Airport</span>
                
              <p>1.12 INFORMATION ON THE AIRPORT</p>
              <p>Djerba International Airport is equipped with a runway 09/27 3100 metres long and lit with beacons.</p>

              <span class="header-blue">Information On The Wreckage And Crash</span>
                
              <p>1.13 INFORMATION ON THE WRECKAGE AND THE CRASH<br /> <br />The searches undertaken have not yet uncovered anything up to the present day.</p>

              <span class="header-blue">Analysis</span>

              <p>II - ANALYSIS:</p>
              <p>As a result of the absence of information on the wreckage and the persons it is difficult to proceed to analyse in any depth the circumstances of this disappearance.<br />However certain indications allow a supposition that the plane would have sent a distress message (the message picked up by the ship ‘Supply Asperay’ while sailing towards Sfax at at 6 nautical miles from the ‘Miskar‘ oil rig platform.</p>
              <p>The questions is posed in respect of the non-detection of this message by the COSPAS world localisation satellite system. .</p>
              <p>After verification by the COSPAS reception centre at Toulouse, it has been proven that during the day of 3.12.95 Tunisian territory was not under satellite cover between 03h 30mn and 04h 52mn. This would explain why the distress signal detected by the ‘Supp1y Asperay’ ship at 04h 4lmn which would not have lasted throughout this time could not have been detected by the satellite at the same time.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, it is emphasised that the weather conditions prevailing on the day of the planes disappearance in the region covering the Djerba/Malta route were unfavourable with the presence of cumulouimbus clouds (unstable and frosty). all the more so that the flight took place at night by instruments only.</p>

              <span class="header-blue">Preliminary Investigations</span>

              <p>III - PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS</p>
              <p>The preliminary examination of the debris and the documents has uncovered the following:</p>
              <p>III-1 Documents</p>
              <p>- An American pilots licence bearing the number 2442642 from 4.10.95<br />- A Maltese professional card bearing the number 4031 valid up to October 1997<br />- A Maltese identity card bearing the number 2977480 from 24.1 1.94<br />- Three bank credit cards<br />- Personal visits cards<br />- Bank notes (US dollars and Maltese lira)</p>
              <p>The documents and bank notes which belonged to the pilot Carmel Bartolo were arranged in a wallet with some keys and were in a legible enough state to be deciphered.</p>
              <p>III-2 Debris</p>
              <p>The Debris which was for the most buckled appeared as thus:</p>
              <p>- the lower part of the cockpit with the engine controls, the direction ‘palonniers’ the control lever of the window, the timoneries and cabling from the flight control.</p>
              <p>- a fragment of the lower part of the fuselage with some cabling and electrical components</p>
              <p>- four seat belts among which two belonging to the front seats were closed and torn from their holdings.</p>
              <p>fragments of flooring and a structure in the form of zi ladder which could be a floorboard.</p>
              <p>• bits of the plane’s upper and lower upholstery.</p>
              <p>First indications on this part of the wreckage have not revealed any trace of fire. Also, the front seat belts which were closed and torn out of their holdings at the state of the<br />retrieved debris would show that the plane had undergone a violent impact with the surface of water (a strong acceleration at the moment of impact).</p>
              <p>It is worth noting that the positions of the engine controls and the flight control levers could give some idea of the flight speed and the plane’s relative position before impact. These positions could be determined after a minute examination in an aeronautical workshop.</p>
