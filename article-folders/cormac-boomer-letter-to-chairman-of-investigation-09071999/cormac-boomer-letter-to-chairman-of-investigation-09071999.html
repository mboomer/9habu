      <div class="header-blue">Final submission by Cormac Boomer written to Dr, Philip Scibberas, Chairman of Investigation Enquiry</div>

      <div class="letter-head">
        <p>36 Riverdale Park North,<br />Belfast BT11 9DL,<br />Northern Ireland<br />9th July 1999</p>
      </div>

      <p>Dr, Philip Scibberas, LLD.,<br />Chairman of Investigation Enquiry,<br />Courts of Justice,<br />Valletta,<br />Malta.</p>

      <p>Subject: <strong>Aviation Incident 3rd December, 1995. The Disappearance of Piper 9H-ABU.</strong>

      <p>Chairman and Members of the Court,</p>

      <p>I refer to the recent final Sitting of this Court on 24th July 1999 and take this opportunity to submit my comments and observations on aspects of the evidence which has been presented by way of explaining the disappearance of Piper 9H ABU on which my son Desmond was reported to have been a passenger.</p>

      <p>In setting out to compile my final submissions I find that this is to a large extent unnecessary as all of the comments and requests I had in mind had already been addressed by Ms. Cecelia Pelligrini Petit in her submission of 17th June l999.</p>

      <p>You will no doubt be aware that during the past three years Ms. Pelligrini Petit and I have co-operated very closely compiling and cross referencing the evidence presented in Court while pursuing our own individual lines of enquiry, I am, therefore, in total agreement with her submission of l7th June, 1999, and support her requests for further investigation into these matters which, when taken collectively or individually, bring into sharp focus the failure to date to tie down the time tables of departure and arrival times of the aircraft in question, depending on which document is read there is a discrepancy of up to one hour and fifteen minutes difference in recorded times.</p>

      <p>There has been a similar shortfall when dealing with individuals brought before the Court, here I have in mind Travel Agents, Couriers and such who appear to have free access to Luqa Airport without reference to anyone. Their attitude to the Court was reflected in their failure to furnish documentation requested by the Court.</p>

      <p>Then there is the Government Officials and Civil Servants responsible for overseeing land enforcing flight safety regulations as laid down by International Law, not just for major operators such as Air Malta but especially in relation to fly by night cowboy operators such as Sun Aviation and Excelair, to name but two.</p>

      <p>The Department of Civil Aviation was grossly negligent in this regard and their ham fistedness is reflected in their handling of the matter of their own A.T.C. Tapes, highlighting the degree of their gross incompetence.</p>

      <p><strong>The Wreckage</strong></p>

      <p>The chequered history of these items raises more questions than answers. I have publicly questioned the veracity of these items in Court and in public without response either from the Court or the Department of Civil Aviation, and I wonder why?</p>

      <p>With public sittings now at an end I trust the Court will take the time to thoroughly investigate these matters and those listed by Ms. Pelligrini Petit in her Submission of 17th June 1999.</p>

      <p>Finally, one last item of equal importance, it relates to an item of evidence I sought to convey to the Court three years ago, i.e. the statement made by one Andrew Williams to his uncle in Liverpool on l2th December 1995 land conveyed to me on the l5th December 1995 by Mr. G. H. Williams, the brother of the missing English man.</p>

      <p>For reasons best known to itself the Court has refused to address this issue which I consider to be of vital importance to resolving the mystery of Piper 9H ABU and the disappearance of it's pilot and five passengers.</p>

      <p>My Affidavit has been prepared in line with the format you indicated at the last Sitting of the Court. I trust it will assist you and the Board Members in successfully completing your investigations.</p>

      <p>I take this opportunity on behalf of our family circle to thank you and the other Members of the Board for your efforts on our behalf.</p>

      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
