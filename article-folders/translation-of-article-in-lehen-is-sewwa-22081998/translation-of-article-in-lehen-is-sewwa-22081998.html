      <h3>The Shadow Of Djerba</h3>

      <p>Saturday 22nd August 1998</p>

      <p>There is a very heavy shadow on something that happened between Djerba and Malta. It would be beneficial to all that the quicker we find out the truth the better.</p>
      <p>Because of the sanctions of the United Nations on Libya. The flights between Malta and Libya stopped. These flights stopped also from all countries in the United Nations and that want to obey the punishment that was agreed between the United Nations until Libya speaks up about the allegations against her about the dropping of the American plane over Lockerbie on its way to America from Frankfurt Germany. There were rumours that a bomb left Malta on an air Malta pane but till today nobody was to prove this.</p>

      <p>Libya is therefore deprived from any flight servcies provided by air companies. There is only a service by vessel between Malta and Libya. When the Libyans provide this for their needs. Things like this leave a wave of headaches and problems.<br /><br />Whoever wants to arrive in Libya or leave Libya has to take the road to Egypt or to Tunisia but first making a journey by car and after takes a plane. In Libya there are a lot of people woking, some in oil companies and some in other. If you are in a camp in the desert you will be very anxious to leave when you are free. To provide air servcies some Maltese know how to fly small aircraft started operating from the airport of the island of Djerba. Tunisia and taking passengers that wanted to reach Malta quickly or leave Malta to go to Libya.<br /><br />Everything was functioning well until something very sad happened. The plane that is said to have left Djerba, was lost on its way to Malta. There were various rumours of how and why this plane was lost. Some came out with a story that the alternator belt of the engine was torn apart when the plane was on its way to Djerba from Malta. Some say that there could be something that happened in the air between Djerba and Malta. Some say that the Tunisians pertend to be deaf in order to leave the maltese commission listen to the words of the Tunisian officials and the Maltese pilot on his way to Malta. Some say that during the flight from Djerba airport to Malta there was not enough agreement and also in order to be able to keep an eye on what was going on until it arrived in Malta and therefore we found out to late.<br /><br />From info that arrived to the Maltese public it shows that the Tunisian authorities are playing deaf or have helped half heartedly. Strange that a serious Maltese pilot and of great integrity and who would want to cotinue doing these private fight would forget to check his alternator belt before leaving to return to Malta. It says the Tunisians to give all the help.</p>

      <p>This is like the case of Milena Bianchi the Italian girl who disappeared after leaving the house where she was living in Tunisia. At first the Tunisian authorities could not give any help on info about her disappearance and gave the impression that maybe the girl wanted to get away from here parents and was hiding from them or also maybe returned to Italy without wanting anyone to find her. But the parents were very upset about all this and went to Tunisia. They searched and put pressure on the Italian ambassador and the Italian television kept mentioning Milena Bianchi. When rumours started going aroud that it was not advisable for Tourists to go to Tunisia the Tunisian authorities understood that this would affect them. The Tunisian police suddenly found her killer. So after all it was possible to find her. Tunisia should also keep watch on her shores about Tunisians carrying people to Lampedusa, Pantelleria and the rest of Siciliy and these to find better living in Italy or any other country in Euope.
      <br /><br />
      Malta also sends a lot of tourists to Tunisia and Maltese are spending money in Tunisia. It woul also pay Tunisia to help as she would benefit also from the oil exploration. These things do not do much good to anyone when things like this happen</p>
