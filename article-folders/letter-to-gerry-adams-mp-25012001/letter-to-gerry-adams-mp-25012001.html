      <div class="letter-head">
        <p>36 Riverdale Park North<br />Andersontown<br />Belfast BT11 9DL</p>
        <p>25th January 2001</p>
      </div>

      <p>Gerry Adams M.P.<br />President of Sinn Féin<br />c/o Connelly House<br />Anderstown Road<br />Belfast BT11</p>

      <p>Dear Gerry,</p>

      <p>The enclosed documentation relates to the five year search for our missing son and our efforts to establish the truth surrounding his disappearance in Djerba on 5th December 1995.</p>

      <p>The search for information has been vigorously pursued by the Aqualina family in Malta, the Williams family in Liverpool and ourselves, at our own expense in time and finance which to date has been considerable. We had been aware for some time that Government in Malta had made an application to join the Eurpoean community, arising from which we, the Williams and Boomer families have agreed to adopt a new strategy in our<br />seaqch for the truth surrounding this incident.</p>

      <p>We have decided to request our respective Governments through their Foreign Offices and European Representatives to press the Authorities in Malta to establish an International Independent Enquiry into this incident as provided for under International Civil Aviation regulations, we have suggested to our Governments’that this should be done as part of our Government's support for their application for membership.</p>

      <p>The Government of Malta should be called to account for it's handling of the investigation into the disappearance of European Citizens within (as they claim) their jurisdiction,our frustrating experiences of the past five years have convinced us the Maltese Authorities will continue to ignore the voices of the families of the missing until such time as our own Governments and their European Representatives support our requests for accountability and truth.</p>

      <p>The enclosed documents are for your information and records.</p>

      <p>(A) A brief summary of the information I have gathered during my investigations since December 1995.<br />(B) My final submission to the Board of Enquiry.<br />(C) My Affidavit to the Enquiry. a similar document was submitted by Geoff Williams confirming the information he conveyed to me on the afternoon of 15th December 1995.<br />(D) An article written by Journalist Don Mullan for the Ireland on Sunday.</p>
      <p>ln December I raised this matter with the European Commission through it’s office in Belfast, Jim Dougal, Head of Commission informs me that my documents and correspondence have been forwarded to the Malta Unit in Brussels, I have also forwarded this correspondence to our three MEPs.<br /><br />l recognise that at this time you are heavily engaged in matters related to our on-going Peace Process, and I wish you every success in your efforts, however, as my member of Parliament the enclosed information is important in the event that you would at some future date be in a position to make enquiries on our behalf that would, hopefully, unlock the closed doors and breach the official wall of silence that has surrounded this incident from the outset.</p>

      <p>ln conclusion I wish to thank you on behalf of all the relatives of the missing for taking the time to read these documents and trust you will support our quest for accountability and truth.</p>
