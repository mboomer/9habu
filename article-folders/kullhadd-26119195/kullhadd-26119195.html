      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <p>ll Kullhadd</p>
      <p>26 November. 1995</p>

      <p><strong>Danger in the Air</strong></p>

      <p>People close to air travel are very worried about the danger that is being brought now that a lot of people have to fly to Tunisia on small planes because the ship between Malta and Libya is not operating.</p>

      <p>Persons who are taking these planes are not being given tickets to show when they leave on the plane. They are being told to go to the airport and they have to be there at a certain time to take the flight.</p>

      <p>This is being done so that people who want to go to Libya for work in connection with oil are being taken as if to pretend that someone is doing them a favour and are not taking the commercial flight where they have to pay money.</p>

      <p>The planes that take these passengers that pay need pilots with commerical licences to fly them and also neex to have serious insurances. The small planes that are carrying people to Tunisia to go to Libya have no licences to carry passengers more than 30 miles off Malta.</p>

      <p>Amongst the ones flying these planes there are pilots that have only a licences to fly a private plane and that is not enough to be able to fly a commerical plane for passengers.</p>

      <p>The Dept of Aviation is allowing these flights to take place knowing the dangers that could arise. lf a plane of this type had to crash being driven by a<br />pilot holding a private licence only and if these companies have no schemes of large insurancesrenought to be able to cover in case of a crash there are going to be big problems.</p>

      <p>The families of the passengers that are hit with such incidents can sue these companies for big amounts. The Maltese passengers can sue the companies that operate these flights for thousands. But the families of Americans and Germans that are using this service can sue for millions. They can sue the companies, the Dept of Civil Aviation and the Govt. of Malta that are allowing these flights to take place in this manner.</p>
