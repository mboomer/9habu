<!-- Letter written by Cormac Boomer to Don Mullan, on 16th July 1999 -->

<p style="text-align: right;">36 Riverdale Park North<br />Belfast BT11 9DL,<br />Northern Ireland.<br />16th July, 1999.</p>
<p>Mr. Don Mullan,<br />Dublin 12.</p>
<p>Dear Don,</p>
<p>At the outset I wish to record my pleasure that a Journalist and author of your status has taken an interest in our family tragedy.</p>
<p>From your discussions with Cecelia you will be aware that from the outset we have come up against an Official and Diplomatic wall of silence, in fact it has been stated to me by a source I can trust, quote: "The diplomatic wall of silence surroundingthis incident is built so high it is almost as if the incident never occurred."</p>
<p>In putting together background information I have taken the following from my files, they are numbered in sequence with comments and explanations.</p>
<p>1. Report from Times Malta, 26th June l999.</p>
<p>2. My final submission to the Court of Enquiry.</p>
<p>3. My Affidavit duly authorised. This information was first presented to the Chairman of the Enquiry privately in August 1996. It is no exaggeration to state that he very angrily threw it back in my face, he has steadfastly refused to accept or address it, hence the Affidavit.</p>
<p>4. Is my first official contact/report to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Dublin.</p>
<p>5. Communications received from Foreign Affairs during the period of the search.</p>
<p>6. This is a copy of a Manifest by fax supplied by Tunisia Djerba in response to request by Malta Department of Civil Aviation for details of passengers supposed to be on board the missing plane, not very official or professional by Tunisian standards.</p>
<p>7. Details from local papers. Ref: Shaqaqi's assassination and subsequent information from Internet, March l996.</p>
<p>8. An extract from Malta paper highlighting the failure of Malta Department of Civil Aviation to enforce international safety regulations, it is no accident that the international body (Regulator) lists Malta on the same level as African countries.</p>
<p>9. From the Malta Times - The content confirmed our growing suspicions of an official cover-up.</p>
<p>10. From the Malta Independent, this information has never been addressed by the Court.</p>
<p>11. Again this matter has never been addressed by the Court of Enquiry.</p>
<p>12. Letter from Rodney Wood re experiences on outbound flight on Saturday 2nd December 1995. I was present in Court when he repeated the content of the letter. I later spoke to him and Mr. Silts, another passenger, they confirmed the incident of the alternator belt, Silts informed me that he spoke to Desmond and Tad Gorny in the airport coffee shop, the last time they were seen.</p>
<p>13. The Preface of this document was written two hours prior to the Sitting of the Court.</p>
<p>14. This document relates to Page 1 of Document 13, no questions or comment was ever made by the Chairman or Legal Representatives regarding it's content.</p>
<p>15. From this document you will note that to effect repairs, i.e. replace the altinator belt the propeller has to be removed (not a two minute job.)</p>
<p>16. This section contains a transcript (translated) of the Tunisian Investigation which was completed on 18<sup>th</sup> December 1995, you will note the conflict of take off times stated (note Malta and Tunisia are in the same time zone.)</p>
<p>17. This ia a compilation of theories and questions put together by Daniel and I in December 1998 and a detailed sequence of events up to May 1999.</p>
<p>18. The Bartolo letter. Ref: EuroJet Ltd.</p>
<p>19. The reporter picked this up wrong, this statement relates to a statement made to me by a Warrant Officer of the Malta Armed Forces who stated he was on duty the morning of the incident. I have his name and address which conformed to my satisfaction, similarly the Civilian Flyer I would like to discuss the details with you.</p>
<p>20. These are extracts from Religious Publications printed in Malta.</p>
