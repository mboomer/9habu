      <p><strong>Message</strong></p>

      <p>I am enclosing a typed Press Release which has been published in "The Times of Malta” today.</p>

      <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THREE MALTESE AMONG SIX MISSING AFTER PLANES DISAPPEARANCE</span></strong></p>

      <p>Search resumes today.</p>

      <p>Aircraft from Malta, Tunisia and the United States Navy are this morning due to resume a search for a single-engined Piper Lance aircraft which went missing with six people on board while on its way to Malta yesterday.</p>

      <p>The aircraft, flying from Djerba in Tunisia, had been expected at Luqa at 6.30am, but nothing was heard of it after a radio message to Tunisian air traffic control at 5:11am, some 25 minutes after take-off the Department of information said the aircraft, which at the time was some 200 miles south west of Malta , did not report anything wrong, but there was a thunderstorm in the area at the time and the aircraft faced a strong north-easterly headwind The alarm was raised by the Malta control tower when the aircraft did not show up on radar screens and it did not make air traffic control at the expected time.</p>

      <p>An Italian military mission search and rescue helicopter piloted by a joint Italian Maltese crew quickly sent to the scene , and it was joined in mid-morning by two aircraft of Excelair Services, the company which was operating the missing aircraft on lease. As news spread other Maltese private pilots also joined in the search along with aircraft of the Tunisian air force and the United States Navy. Weather conditions were about as bad as when the aircraft is thought to have gone missing.</p>

      <p>At one time a pilot reported seeing what looked like a life jacket but the sighting could not be confirmed. The aircraft owned by Sun Aviation and leased to Excelair was piloted by Carmelo Bartolo, of Zebbug a director of Sun Aviation. On board were five passengers two of whom were Maltese; Philip Farrugia and Matthew Aquilina of Selima. The others were Briton Michael Williams, Desmond Boomer an Irishman and Gorny Yadeuse , a Polish.</p>

      <p>The Department of information said the Piper left Malta at 6.45pm on Saturday with four passengers on board. The flight was uneventful with radar and radio contact maintained throughout the flight. The Malta Air Control Centre early yesterday received the aircrat’t’s flight plan for its flight back to Malta. It was to depart from Djerba at 4.40am, reaching Malta at 6.30am. The aircraft actually took off at 4.46am.</p>

      <p>At about 5.30am Tunis flight control asked Malta flight control whether the aircraft was in contact with Malta. Malta replied that there had been no contact at all. After further exchanges between Mata and Tunisia an alert message was issued by Malta at 6.18am. The message was sent to Tunis, Tripoli and Lampedusa. Tunis replied that its last contact with aircraft was at 5:11am when the aircraft was at the Flight Information Region boundary between Malta and Tunisia. The aircraft was then flying at 9,000 feet, Lampedusa and Tripoli had no information about the flight.</p>

      <p>A distress message was issued by Malta at 7.00am addressed to Tunis, Monastir, Djerba, Tripoli and Lampedusa, launching the search and rescue operation.</p>

      <p>The Italian Military Mission helicopter took off from Malta a short time afterwards followed at around 10.30am by two aircraft belonging to Excelair. The Tunisian air force sent five search and rescue aircraft and the US navy reported deployed PC 3 Orian surveillance aircraft. Djerba is located close to the Libyan border and is a gateway for many people travelling to and From Libya which has no air links with the rest of the world because of UN imposed sanctions in connection with the 1988 Pan Am aircraft bombing over Lockerbie , Scotland.</p>
