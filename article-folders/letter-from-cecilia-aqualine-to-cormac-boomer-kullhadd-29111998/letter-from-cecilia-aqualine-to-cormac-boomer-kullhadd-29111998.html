<h3>Letter from Cecilia to Cormac Boomer</h3>
<p>29 November 1998</p>
<p>Dear Cormac and Alice</p>
<p>I am sending you a translation ot a newspaper cutting <a href="index.php/component/content/article/50-kullhadd/100-article-published-in-kullhadd" title="Article published in Kullhadd"><strong>Kullhadd article</strong></a> which was in an old newspaper in 1995 prior to the incident. I managed to get this newspaper and have made a literal translation. It is not in very good English but l did not bother to polish it. I translated literally.</p>
<p>As you can see someone was warning the authorities that these flights should not be taking place. Apparently the Transport Dept ignored those warnings.</p>
<p>I presume that it we sue the Govt and Civil Aviation for large sums we might get a reaction of some sort.</p>
<p>I think we have to sue the individuals at Civil Aviation such as Sultana who has incidentially now been appointed Director as Fenech has retired. Believe it or not Sultana who has been appearing in Court together with Fenech and Sultana is the guy who was on duty and it took him ages to get out the searches and to get to the airport on that fatal day. This guy is now Director of Civil Aviation.</p>
<p>Please give me your views ??'?</p>
<p>I am not interested In the money I am interested in nailing a few people to tell us the truth and if we sue individuals it is even better as they will panic and will let the cat out of the bag.</p>
<p>What do you think???</p>
<p>[Note: the newspaper article also contained an article on Shqaqi]</p>
